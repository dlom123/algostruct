# AlgoStruct

AlgoStruct is a computer science playground! It allows you to visualize and interact with algorithms and data structures, working through them step by step so you can understand them from the computer's perspective.

The steps for each algorithm are outlined as high-level instructions and also in source code in multiple languages. Just follow the steps, clicking through the interactive interface to learn and practice computer science principles!
